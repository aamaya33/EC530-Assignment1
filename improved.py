#Could use K-D Tree and use nearest neighbors query to find the closest point, but would i have to remake the tree every time? recalculating distance for each point in arrA?
#plan is to use k-d tree, find k nearest neighbors and run distance formula on that. ripping most of implementation from geek4geeks
